# Todo Manager Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Core CRUD Operations âœ… (In Progress)

- [x] Basic project creation and listing
- [x] Basic todo creation with project assignment
- [x] Todo completion tracking with actual hours
- [ ] **Edit existing todos**
  - Update title, description, priority, estimated hours
  - Change project assignment
  - Modify due dates and tags
- [ ] **Delete/cancel todos**
  - Soft delete (mark as cancelled) vs hard delete
  - Bulk delete operations
- [ ] **Edit existing projects**
  - Update name, description, color
  - Archive/deactivate projects
- [ ] **Delete projects**
  - Handle todos in deleted projects (reassign or cascade delete)
  - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Phase 2: LLM Integration & Prioritization

- [ ] **LLM API integration**
  - OpenAI/Anthropic API client setup
  - Environment variable configuration for API keys
- [ ] **Smart prioritization endpoint**
  - Send pending todos to LLM for re-prioritization
  - Consider due dates, effort estimates, project context
  - Allow manual override of LLM suggestions
- [ ] **Batch prioritization**
  - Prioritize all pending todos in a project
  - Global prioritization across all projects
- [ ] **Priority reasoning**
  - Store LLM's reasoning for priority decisions
  - Display reasoning in UI for transparency

## Phase 3: Scheduling & Time Management

- [ ] **Daily capacity calculation**
  - Historical analysis of completed tasks
  - Configurable daily/weekly work hour limits
  - Buffer time for interruptions and meetings
- [ ] **Smart scheduling algorithm**
  - Auto-assign todos to days based on capacity
  - Consider due dates and dependencies
  - Handle priority conflicts and overallocation
- [ ] **Weekly/daily view**
  - Calendar-style interface for scheduled todos
  - Drag-and-drop rescheduling
  - Visual capacity indicators (over/under allocated days)
- [ ] **Time blocking**
  - Assign specific time slots to todos
  - Integration with calendar apps (optional)

## Phase 4: PDF Generation & Remarkable Sync

- [ ] **PDF template system**
  - Design optimized layouts for Remarkable tablet (10.3" e-ink)
  - Checkbox forms for analog completion tracking
  - Multiple template options (daily, weekly, project-focused)
- [ ] **PDF generation API**
  - Daily todo lists with time blocks
  - Weekly overview with capacity planning
  - Project status reports
- [ ] **Remarkable integration**
  - `rmapi` CLI integration for automated sync
  - File naming conventions for organization
  - Sync scheduling (daily, on-demand)
- [ ] **Analog-digital workflow**
  - QR codes for quick task lookup
  - Mobile companion for quick completions
  - Photo capture of handwritten notes

## Phase 5: Analytics & Insights

- [ ] **Enhanced completion tracking**
  - Track partial completions and task abandonment
  - Time tracking integration (Toggl, RescueTime)
  - Interruption and context switch logging
- [ ] **Productivity analytics dashboard**
  - Estimation accuracy trends
  - Productivity patterns by time of day/week
  - Project velocity and burn-down charts
- [ ] **Capacity optimization**
  - Suggest optimal daily capacity based on historical data
  - Identify productivity bottlenecks
  - Recommend schedule adjustments
- [ ] **Export and reporting**
  - CSV export for external analysis
  - Weekly/monthly productivity reports
  - Project completion summaries

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

- [ ] **Task dependencies**
  - Define prerequisite tasks
  - Automatic scheduling based on dependencies
  - Critical path analysis for projects
- [ ] **Recurring tasks**
  - Daily, weekly, monthly patterns
  - Template-based task creation
  - Automatic scheduling of recurring items
- [ ] **Collaboration features**
  - Shared projects with team members
  - Task assignment and delegation
  - Comment threads on tasks
- [ ] **Mobile optimization**
  - Progressive Web App (PWA) configuration
  - Touch-friendly interface for tablets
  - Offline capability with sync

## Phase 7: Integrations & Automation

- [ ] **Calendar integration**
  - Google Calendar, Outlook sync
  - Automatic time blocking
  - Meeting awareness for capacity planning
- [ ] **Email integration**
  - Create todos from emails
  - Send daily/weekly planning emails
  - Task completion notifications
- [ ] **GitHub integration**
  - Create todos from GitHub issues
  - Link commits to completed tasks
  - Project progress tracking
- [ ] **Automation workflows**
  - IFTTT/Zapier integration
  - Slack notifications for overdue tasks
  - Automatic project archiving

## Technical Debt & Improvements

- [ ] **Error handling**
  - Comprehensive error boundaries
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Retry mechanisms for API failures
- [ ] **Performance optimization**
  - Database indexing and query optimization
  - Frontend caching strategies
  - Lazy loading for large todo lists
- [ ] **Security**
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Rate limiting on API endpoints
  - User authentication and authorization
- [ ] **Testing**
  - Unit tests for database operations
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - End-to-end testing for critical workflows
- [ ] **Documentation**
  - API documentation
  - User guide for workflow setup
  - Deployment and configuration guides

## Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Order)

1. **Edit/Delete functionality** - Complete the basic CRUD operations
2. **LLM prioritization** - Core value proposition of intelligent task management
